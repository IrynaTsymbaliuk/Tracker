# Tracker — Sample App

This sample application demonstrates how to integrate and use the **Tracker** library to monitor language learning, reading, social media usage, movie watching, step counting, meditation, and exercise.

## Features Demonstrated

### 1. Library Setup

```kotlin
val tracker = Tracker.Builder(context)
    .setLetterboxdUsername("your_username")  // optional: required only for movie watching
    .build()
```

### 2. Permission Handling

The app handles two separate permissions:

**Usage Stats** (`PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`) — required for language learning, reading, social media, and the meditation-app-foreground branch:
```kotlin
// Check via AppOpsManager
val mode = appOps.checkOpNoThrow(
    AppOpsManager.OPSTR_GET_USAGE_STATS, Process.myUid(), packageName
)
// Direct the user to the system usage access settings screen
startActivity(Intent(Settings.ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS))
```

**Health Connect** — required for step counting (`health.READ_STEPS`), the HealthConnect branch of meditation (`health.READ_MINDFULNESS`), and exercise (`health.READ_EXERCISE`). All three are requested in a single runtime prompt:
```kotlin
val launcher = registerForActivityResult(
    PermissionController.createRequestPermissionResultContract()
) { updateHcPermissionUi() }

launcher.launch(setOf(
    HealthPermission.getReadPermission(StepsRecord::class),
    HealthPermission.getReadPermission(MindfulnessSessionRecord::class),
    HealthPermission.getReadPermission(ExerciseSessionRecord::class)
))
```

Both permissions show inline status rows with a "Grant" button that appears only when a permission is missing. The Health Connect status row distinguishes between "none granted" (`✗`), "partial" (`◐` with the list of missing items), and "all granted" (`✓`).

### 3. Querying Metrics

All metrics are queried for today (midnight → now). Each query is wrapped independently so a failure in one does not affect the others:

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    val language   = runCatching { tracker.queryLanguageLearning() }.getOrNull()
    val reading    = runCatching { tracker.queryReading() }.getOrNull()
    val social     = runCatching { tracker.querySocialMedia() }.getOrNull()
    val movies     = runCatching { tracker.queryMovieWatching() }.getOrNull()
    val steps      = runCatching { tracker.queryStepCounting() }.getOrNull()
    val meditation = runCatching { tracker.queryMeditation() }.getOrNull()
    val exercise   = runCatching { tracker.queryExercise() }.getOrNull()
    displayResults(language, reading, social, movies, steps, meditation, exercise)
}
```

A `null` result means either no activity in the time range or a missing/denied permission.

### 4. Displaying Results

Each metric is shown as a summary line:

- **Language**: `📚 Language    45 min · HIGH · 85%`
- **Reading**: `📖 Reading    30 min · MEDIUM · 75%`
- **Social**: `📱 Social    120 min · HIGH · 88%`
- **Movies**: `🎬 Movies    3 films · HIGH · 95%`
- **Steps**: `👣 Steps    7,622 steps · HIGH · 99%`
- **Meditation**: `🧘 Meditation    15 min · 1 session · HC+Usage · 97%`
- **Exercise**: `🏃 Exercise    45 min · 2 sessions · Running, Strength Training · 99%`

**Per-session breakdown.** For the usage-based metrics (Language, Reading, Social) and Steps, the
sample expands the summary line into one indented line per session, showing **time from – time to**
and the **app name** (or step count). This comes straight from each result's `sessions` list — the
library always returns it; the app simply renders it:

```
📱 Social    120 min · HIGH · 88%
    • 08:02–08:19 · Instagram (17 min)
    • 12:40–13:05 · Reddit (25 min)
    • 21:10–22:28 · Instagram (78 min)

👣 Steps    7,622 steps · HIGH · 99%
    • 08:00–09:00 · 1,204 steps
    • 12:00–13:00 · 3,560 steps
    • 18:00–19:00 · 2,858 steps
```

`sessionLines()` formats `UsageSession`s (Language, Reading, Social) as `from–to · appName (N min)`;
`stepSessionLines()` formats `StepSession`s as `from–to · N steps`. Timestamps are rendered as local
`HH:mm`. Note that step "sessions" are **hourly Health Connect buckets**, not discrete walking bouts —
empty hours are omitted by the library, so every line shown has a non-zero count.

For meditation, the sample renders the active data sources inline: `HC` for Health Connect, `Usage` for UsageStats, `HC+Usage` when both contributed and were merged. `—` is shown when the result is null (no data or no permission granted on either source).

For exercise, the sample lists the distinct exercise types that appeared in the window (title-cased, comma-separated), deduplicated across sessions. Confidence is a flat 99% since all data comes from Health Connect `ExerciseSessionRecord`.

## How to Run

1. **Install on device**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:installDebug
   ```

2. **Grant Usage Access**:
   - Tap "Grant" next to "Usage access  ✗"
   - Find "Tracker Demo" in the list and enable "Permit usage access"
   - Return to the app — metrics update automatically

3. **Grant Health Connect** (optional, for step counting, the HealthConnect branch of meditation, and exercise):
   - Tap "Grant" next to the Health Connect row
   - Approve `Steps`, `Mindfulness sessions`, and `Exercise sessions` in the Health Connect dialog
   - Return to the app — step count, meditation, and exercise results appear automatically

4. **Enable Movie Watching** (optional):
   - Set `letterboxdUsername` in `MainActivity.kt` to your Letterboxd username

5. **Refresh**:
   - Tap "Query Today" to manually refresh all metrics

## Code Structure

├── updateUsagePermissionUi()   # Show/hide Grant button based on AppOps check
├── hasUsageStatsPermission()   # AppOpsManager permission check
├── updateHcPermissionUi()      # Show/hide Grant button based on HC permission state (steps + mindfulness + exercise)
├── queryMetrics()              # Query all seven metrics concurrently using coroutines
├── displayResults()            # Render the summary line per metric
├── sessionLines()              # Expand UsageSession list into "from–to · appName (N min)" lines
├── stepSessionLines()          # Expand StepSession list into "from–to · N steps" lines (hourly buckets)
├── sourcesLabel()              # Render MeditationResult.sources as "HC+Usage"
└── titleCase()                 # Convert "strength_training" → "Strength Training" for exercise type labels
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Builder Pattern**: Configure the Tracker with a fluent API — no `enable*` flags needed, all features are always available
2. **Coroutines**: All query methods are `suspend` functions; wrap each independently with `runCatching` so one failure doesn't block the rest
3. **Two permission flows**: `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` requires a manual system settings redirect; Health Connect permissions use the runtime permission contract
4. **Multiple Health Connect permissions in one prompt**: pass a `Set` with all required `HealthPermission` strings to `launcher.launch(...)` — the user only sees items they haven't granted
5. **Health Connect manifest setup**: Both `ACTION_SHOW_PERMISSIONS_RATIONALE` (Android 9–13) and the `VIEW_PERMISSION_USAGE` activity-alias (Android 14+) must be declared for the permission dialog to work
6. **Step counting deduplication**: Use `queryStepCounting()` rather than summing `StepsRecord` entries manually — Health Connect's aggregation API handles deduplication across Google Fit, the phone step counter, and other sources
7. **Multi-source fusion for meditation**: `queryMeditation()` merges HealthConnect `MindfulnessSessionRecord`s with foreground sessions of known meditation apps. Overlapping sessions are deduplicated, and the result's `sources` list reflects which sources contributed. If HealthConnect is unavailable, the call gracefully falls back to UsageStats-only.
8. **Exercise from Health Connect**: `queryExercise()` reads `ExerciseSessionRecord`s written by any fitness app (Strava, Google Fit, Samsung Health, manual log, etc.). Each session exposes both `exerciseTypeId` (the raw HC int) and `exerciseType` (a snake_case string) so the app can choose programmatic or display-friendly treatment. The sample uses a title-case transform (`"strength_training"` → `"Strength Training"`) for display.

## Testing

The app works best when you have supported apps installed and have used them today.

**Supported language learning apps:**
- Duolingo, Anki, LingoDeer, Drops
- Japanese learning apps: Kanji Study, Renshuu, J5a, Hey Japan, JP News, Mytest, TenWords
- And 2 more (see `KnownApps.kt` for the complete list)

**Supported reading apps:**
- Kindle, Google Play Books

**Supported social media apps:**
- Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, Snapchat
- Reddit, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Discord, Threads
- WhatsApp, Telegram, Mastodon, Bluesky, Tumblr

**Supported meditation apps:**
- Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer, Balance, Waking Up
- Smiling Mind, Ten Percent Happier, Medito, MEISOON, Mindvalley

**Movie watching:**
- Set `letterboxdUsername` in `MainActivity.kt` to your Letterboxd username

**Step counting:**
- Requires Health Connect to be installed (built-in on Android 14+; available via Google Play on Android 9–13)
- Grant the `Steps` permission when prompted

**Meditation:**
- Either: use one of the supported meditation apps (detected via UsageStats), or
- Have a meditation app that writes `MindfulnessSessionRecord`s to Health Connect (e.g. Calm), or log a session manually in the Health Connect app
- Grant the `Mindfulness sessions` permission when prompted for best results (both sources merged)

**Exercise:**
- Have any fitness app that writes `ExerciseSessionRecord`s to Health Connect (Strava, Google Fit, Samsung Health, Peloton, etc.), or log a workout manually in the Health Connect app
- Grant the `Exercise sessions` permission when prompted
- All exercise types recognised by Health Connect are supported (running, cycling, strength training, yoga, swimming, etc.)

## Notes

- The sample app requires Android API 26+ (Android 8.0)
- The library itself supports Android API 21+; the higher sample app minimum is due to Health Connect and `java.time` usage
- `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` is a protected permission that requires user action in system settings
- Queries always cover today from midnight in the device's local timezone
- On Android 10+, session times use precise `ACTIVITY_RESUMED`/`ACTIVITY_PAUSED` events
- `MindfulnessSessionRecord` requires a recent `androidx.health.connect:connect-client` release. On older HC installations, the meditation query transparently falls back to UsageStats-only.
- `ExerciseSessionRecord` is authoritative — confidence is fixed at `0.99` because these records are written by fitness apps or entered manually by the user. Sessions shorter than one minute still appear in `sessions` (rounded to `0 min`) so the session count remains accurate.
